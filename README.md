## OneTap
This is a simple e-commerce application built using Flutter. However, I acknowledge that there are still areas for improvement in this application. Hopefully, in the future, I can learn more about building the application.

## Specification
- Splash Screen: The opening screen that appears when the application is first launched, typically used to display a logo or brief message.
- Onboarding Screen: Guide screens that provide information to users about the features or benefits of the application before they begin using it.
- Login and Register: Feature that allows users to sign in or register for an account within the application. Im using firebase authentication
- Home Screen: Main screen of the application displaying primary content or navigation menu for users.
- Data Products: Information related to products, such as product listings, descriptions, images, and prices.
- Account Profile: Page or screen where users can view and manage their profile information, including account details and personal settings.
